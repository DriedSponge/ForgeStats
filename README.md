# About

This mod will upload player world stats from Minecraft to an API end point. I made it, so I could later display said stats on a webpage. It also adds a `/info <player>` command to look up general stats about an online player.
If you are curious about the api side of things, check out [this repo](https://github.com/DriedSponge/DriedSponge.net).

This mod works with Minecraft **1.10.2** and **1.12.2**. It might work on other versions as well but I only tested it on the previously mentioned versions.
(*For some reason it works for 1.10.2 even though I made it for 1.12.2*)
 
 This repo will receive updates when they are necessary. **This is my first minecraft mod so please don't flame me if you spot bad code!**
